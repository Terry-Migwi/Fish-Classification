# Fish-Classification

This repository contains a colab notebook with workings of a Computer Vision problem on using Convolution Neural Networks.

## Title
Fish Images classification using Tensorflow

## Author
Terry Migwi

## Project Description

The main objective of this project is to build a model that can classify fish images with 23 different classes. The dataset was stored in googleapis as a directory and downloaded into googe colab using keras.utils. Image pre-processing was performed using OpenCv and visualization using matplotlib and imshow. Data Augmentation was then performed on the training data and the classification with Convolution Neural Networks using Tensorflow. The classes were highly imbalanced hence precision, recall and F1 score were considered as the evaluation metrics.
